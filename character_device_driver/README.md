The explanation of each step in character device driver development

⸻

✅ 01-init-exit – Module Initialization and Exit
	•	You define two main functions:
	•	__init simple_init() → runs when you insmod the module
	•	__exit simple_exit() → runs when you rmmod the module
	•	Purpose: register and clean up your driver with the Linux kernel.

⸻

✅ 02-major-minor – Assign Major/Minor Numbers
	•	Use alloc_chrdev_region() to dynamically allocate device numbers.
	•	Major number: identifies the driver.
	•	Minor number: identifies the specific device.
	•	Check with dmesg or cat /proc/devices.

⸻

✅ 03-device-file – Create Device File in /dev
	•	Use class_create() and device_create() to make /dev/simple_dev.
	•	This file is what userspace apps read/write to.
	•	If udev is not active, use mknod to create the file manually.

⸻

✅ 04-file-operations – Set Up file_operations
	•	Define handlers for:

.open = dev_open,
.release = dev_close,
.read = dev_read,
.write = dev_write


	•	These functions handle user interactions like cat, echo, etc.

✅ 05-fops-rw – Implement read() and write()
	•	read() uses copy_to_user() → sends data to userspace.
	•	write() uses copy_from_user() → receives data from userspace.
	•	offset helps keep track of current read/write position.
	•	Print debug messages to dmesg using pr_info().
